     * This endpoint can be used to cancel one or more order lines that were previously authorized using a *pay after delivery* payment method. Use the Cancel order endpoint if you want to cancel the
     * entire order or the remainder of the order.
     *
     * Canceling or partially canceling an order line will immediately release the authorization held for that amount. Your customer will be able to see the updated order in his portal / app. Any
     * canceled lines will be removed from the customer's point of view, but will remain visible in the Mollie Dashboard.
     *
     * You should cancel an order line if you do not intend to (fully) ship it.
     *
     * An order line can only be canceled while its `status` field is either `authorized` or `shipping`. If you cancel an `authorized` order line, the new order line status will be `canceled`. Canceling
     * a `shipping` order line will result in a `completed` order line status.
     *
     * If the order line is `paid` or already `completed`, you should create a refund using the Create order refund endpoint instead.
     *
     * For more information about the status transitions please check our order status changes guide.
     *
     * @since 3.0.0
     * @deprecated Use `cancel` instead.

    /**
     * This endpoint can be used to update an order line. Only the lines that belong to an order with status `created`, `pending` or `authorized` can be updated.
     *
     * Use cases for this endpoint could be updating the `name`, `productUrl`, `imageUrl`, and `metadata` for a certain order line because your customer wants to swap the item for a different variant,
     * for example exchanging a blue skirt for the same skirt in red.
     *
     * Or update the `quantity`, `unitPrice`, `discountAmount`, `totalAmount`, `vatAmount` and `vatRate` if you want to substitute a product for an entirely different one.
     *
     * Alternatively, you can also (partially) cancel order lines instead of updating the quantity.
     *
     * When updating an order line that uses a *pay after delivery* method such as *Klarna Pay later*, Klarna may decline the requested changes, resulting in an error response from the Mollie API. The
     * order remains intact, though the requested changes are not persisted.
